### 📌 Notes:
- Replace `https://github.com/Pratik667/investment-calculator.git` with your actual repo URL.
- Add `screenshots/` folder with `input.png` and `results.png` if you'd like screenshots to show.
- If you're deploying (e.g., via Vercel or Netlify), I can help add a **live demo** badge/link.

Want me to generate a minimal one for NPM or GitHub Pages too?
